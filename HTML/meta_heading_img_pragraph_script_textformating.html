                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research
                Organisation,
                where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed
                and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
                successful
                missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s
                first
                intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in
                1989.
                Chandigarh. Statuettes at the Rock Garden of Chandigarh a sculpture park in Chandigarh, India, also
                known as
                Nek Chand's Rock Garden. Created by Nek Chand Saini an Indian self taught artist. visionary artist, folk
                artist,
                environmental art.
                From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific
                adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the
                country’s 1998
                nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests
                caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called
                Technology
                Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a
                developed society
                in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity,
                emphasizing technology
                as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
                In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
                President Kocheril
                Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim,
                and his
                stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress,
                also proposed
                his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely
                ceremonial post, in
                July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the
                country’s first woman president.
                Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform
                India into a
                developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while
                delivering a
                lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon
                afterward.
                Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999). Among his numerous awards
                were two of the
                country’s highest honours, the Padma Vibhushan (1990) and the Bharat Ratna (1997).
